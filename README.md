I often watch cooking videos on youtube.
Even though I like the videos, I often end up being too lazy to buy all of the ingredients.

This is my attempt at solving this dilemma.

Recitube fetches video transcripts from youtube
It then instruments LLama to perform ingredient extraction.
It provides convenient links to Walmart and Amazon.
