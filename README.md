I often watch cooking videos on youtube.
Even though I like the videos and plan on cooking the recipes at home, I often end up being too lazy to buy all of the ingredients.

This is my attempt at solving this dilemma.

Recitube fetches video transcripts from youtube.
It then instruments Llama-3-8B to perform ingredient extraction in a "vanilla-RAG" fashion.
It provides convenient links to Walmart and Amazon (Whole Foods) to make buying friction-free.
